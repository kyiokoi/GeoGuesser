Process:
1. Use model.py to create the model
2. Use train.py to train the model with the images in /data
3. Use evaluate.py to test the model with the testing split (15%)


Model iterations:

1. 10 epochs, 0.001 learning rate
Highest test accuracy: 60%

2. 25 epochs, 0.001 learning rate
Highest test accuracy: 78%

3. 25 epochs, 0.005 learning rate
Highest test accuracy:
