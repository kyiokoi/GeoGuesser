Process:
1. Store image data in /data folder
2. Use data_balancing.py to ensure all countries have similar number of images
3. Use data_preparation.py to prepare the data (Ensures all images are the same size)
4. Use model.py to create the model
5. Use train.py to train the model with the images in /data
6. Use evaluate.py to test the model with the testing split (15%)


Model iterations:

1. 10 epochs, 0.001 learning rate
Test accuracy: 60%

2. 25 epochs, 0.001 learning rate
Test accuracy: 78%

3. 25 epochs, 0.005 learning rate
Test accuracy: 56.88%

4. 50 epochs, 0.01 learning rate
Test accuracy: 79.11%
